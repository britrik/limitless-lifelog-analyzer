# Merge Preparation Notes for fix/dashboard-refactor -> main

This document outlines key checks and steps before merging the `fix/dashboard-refactor` branch into `main`.

## Pre-Merge Checklist:

1.  **Test API Fetches:**
    *   In development (`npm run dev`): Verify API calls to `/api/limitless/...` are successful (200 OK, no 404s) and are routed through the Vite proxy. Check browser dev tools (Network tab).
    *   (If possible) Test production build (`npm run build && npm run preview`): Verify API calls go directly to `https://api.limitless.com/...`.

2.  **Verify Core Functionality:**
    *   **Dashboard**: Ensure all charts load correctly, handle empty/error states, and respond to time range changes.
    *   **Speaker Context**: Check that speaker context management (e.g., in the Lifelogs page via `ContextManager.tsx` and its use in `TranscriptDetailModal.tsx`) is functioning as expected. Confirm that speaker profiles can be created/edited and are applied during analysis if that integration exists.
    *   **Lifelogs Page**: Ensure transcript listing, selection, and detail view are working.

3.  **Code Quality & Checks:**
    *   Run `npm run typecheck` (or `tsc --noEmit`) to confirm there are no TypeScript errors.
    *   Consider running `npm run lint` and `npm run format` if linters (e.g., ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Prettier) are configured in the project, to ensure code consistency.

## Merge Process:

*   **Squash Commits:** When merging the Pull Request on GitHub, choose the "Squash and merge" option. This will combine all commits from the `fix/dashboard-refactor` branch into a single commit on `main`, keeping the main branch history clean and concise.
    *   Suggested squash commit message: `feat: Refactor Dashboard, improve API handling, types, and UX` (or similar, summarizing the overall impact of the branch).

## Post-Merge:

1.  **Delete Branch:** After merging, delete the `fix/dashboard-refactor` branch on GitHub and locally (`git branch -d fix/dashboard-refactor`).
2.  **Pull Changes:** Ensure your local `main` branch is updated (`git checkout main && git pull origin main`).
3.  **Final Smoke Test:** Briefly re-test the main deployed application (if applicable) or the local main branch version.

*This refactor aimed to improve import/export consistency, fix API fetching issues in development, enhance type safety, and polish user experience for empty/error data states on the Dashboard.*
